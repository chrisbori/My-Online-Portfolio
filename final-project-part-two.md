## Puerto Rico: "There's nothing left here"

A short conversation with my mother stayed with me throughout the years. I grew up in Carolina, Puerto Rico witnessing the strides that she went through to provide for me and my two sisters. I could not understand why it was so hard. When I asked her one day, she replied:  

“Because there’s nothing left here, Christian. There’s nothing left.”   

I continued to hear this statement among teachers and other family members, all referring to my home, Puerto Rico. The news back then incessantly discussed the economic crisis, debt, government corruption, increasing crime rates, and lack of opportunities. Teachers and parents either pushed for students to go to the United States where opportunities were not crumbling down or stressed the importance of saving in the islands. You could not escape it. The infamous debt becomes a part of every kid’s being. To be Puerto Rican was to live in a sinking ship. 

Yet, in all the noise, I challenged the notion that there's nothing left in Puerto Rico. It implies that the islands had nothing to give us, but the islands gave us everything (not to sounf like Moana). Amidst the struggle to live, there was not one moment I wanted to leave, and I believe this to be true for most Puerto Ricans. Then again, it is undeniable that thousands of islanders leave every year. 

In this story, I venture what is going, why are we leaving, what is left, and, most importantly, what do we do. I will focus on themes of displacement and inequality as they relate to the controversial Act 60.

## What is Act 60 (20 and 22)
Act 20 and Act 22 were enacted in 2012, now merged into Act 60. Act 20 reduces the corporate rate tax to 4% (from the US's 21%) for local/external businesses with an external customer base. Act 22 reduces the capital gains tax to 0% for individual investors that have not lived in Puerto Rico, in other words, it can only apply to external investors willing to relocate to Puerto Rico for a minimum of 6 months (Acevedo, 2023). Investors initially had to buy a property, but then-governor Rosello removed this requirement right after hurricane Maria in 2017, which brought upon an influx of investors.

# User research 

## Target audience
> I am focusing on Puerto Rican islanders as my audience and US Americans as my secondary audience. 

## Interview script
> Assess understanding of story: What was the purpose of the story?
> Assess effectiveness of story: Was the story effective in fulfilling its purpose?
> Assess perceptibility of data viz: Did you easily understand the data vizs? What stuck out from them?
> Assess impact of story: Were you engaged with the story? Did it make you care?
> Assess gaps: What questions do you have after the story? Anything missing?
> Assess color choices fo storyboard: Did you like the colors of the storyboard?

## Interview findings
I interviewed one of my sisters and two of my friends, all three of which live in the islands. They had very similar things to say (essentially the same), so I'm writing my findings in one excerpt. 

They really liked how I introduced the story. The connected strongly with "growing up in a sinking ship". They expressed the purpose of the story as understanding the impact of ACT 60 on displacement and inequity (jackpot!). They thought that the story was pretty effective, but it needed more. One of them actually brought up including data on inequity (which I was planning on including but had completely forgotten about!). They also mentioned there should be more direct comparison between housing values and act 22 approvals. From a perceptibility standpoint, they described my charts as easy to digest. Two of the three interviewers said my storyboard thing was a mess (leave it to them to read me for filth), but they all liked the color scheme. Overall, great impact and connection, but gotta flesh out more comparisons for the story. 

One of them mentioned including the amount of donations political parties in PR receive from Act 22 beneficiaries (tea)

# Identified changes for Part III
*I might rethink my storyboad a bit (they got to my head)
*I found the gini index data for Puerto Rico in the US Census, so I'm incorporating that into the story. I'm thinking of contrasting this to the benefits of Act 22 (which are measured by an increase in jobs by the government)
*I'm thinking of including the party donations data
*I have to add my call to action (I'm frankly still a little bit unsure, but I'm considering routing the girls to a community activist group).
