# Everybody poops, but not everybody washes their hands

## Step 1: Choose a data visualization
I browsed different articles within the Makeover Monday link for about 30 minutes, and many of these were insteresting. However, when I read the title "Everybody poops", I needed to know more. I found the following chart claiming that men are less likely to wash their hands after going to the toilet, which I instantly believed because I know my people (PS: they don't represent me). I chose my target.

## Step 2: Critique the data vizualization
I already submitted the Google form, but to recap, here were my main critiques:
* the color choice for women stood out more than men, who I believe were supposed to be the main character
* the main objective of the story felt loss in the volume of information provided
* there are more insights for men than for women, which may be dramatizing the contrast between the two
My main objective with the redesign is to better highlight the comparison between the genders (mainly that men wash their hands less).

## Step 3: Sketch out a solution
I came up with three sketches, which I then rated as "simple, but engaging", "simple, but not engaging" and "coolest", respectively.

# Step 4: Test the solution
I contacted two friends to give me feedback on my sketch:
*student, mid 20's
*student, 30ish (in Telling Stories w/ Data)

The first critic liked the diverging bar the best. They understood the comparative story I was trying to tell with the first two sketches. However, she was very confused about the third sketch. She also advised adding something to clarify who the data represents (my initial title did not specify this data is from the UK). The second critic gave the same feedback (he also said he was disapointed at men). 

Based on this, I chose the diverging bar chart and decided to include the location/date in the title.  

# Step 5: Build your solution
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1707278002518' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;9R&#47;9RBT8F4KW&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='path' value='shared&#47;9RBT8F4KW' /> <param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;9R&#47;9RBT8F4KW&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1707278002518');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} 
  else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} 
  else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}                     
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

So, when I looked at the data provided through Makeover Monday, there was much less than I expected. I thought there would be more data (e.g., the original chart included standing wee and sitting wee, but this was not in the file). There were only three scenarios in the data: while at work, while at home, and while out.
