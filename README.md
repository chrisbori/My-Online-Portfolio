# Portfolio
Welcome to my online data visualization portfolio! Here's where all my cool work will go, mainly data stories with vizualizations. I hope you enjoy!

# About me
I'm a user-centric, digital transformation leader (and avid coffee-drinker) graduating from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2025. I'm proudly (some would say too proudly) from Carolina, Puerto Rico. 

I have a bachelor's degree in Policy Studies from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, where I gained communication, data analysis, and problem-solving skills. I then took those skills (and my Puerto Rican coffee beans) to the City of Syracuse as the first employee hired in the Digital Services division of IT. Our team built a digital transformation roadmap and developed product implementation frameworks for the City. My biggest role entailed the discovery and implementation of the City's new timekeeping system as the product lead. To increase my technical acumen, I am now pursuing a Master of Science in Public Policy and Management with a focus on Data Analytics from the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. 

# What I hope to learn

1. Color theory to support storytelling through data
2. Different types of vizualizations I have never worked with before (going beyond the bar chart, pie chart, and line chart trifecta)
3. Some Tableau
4. I have never worked with Github before, but it looks really cool! So that too :)

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
