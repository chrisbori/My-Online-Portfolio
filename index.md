# My online portfolio
Welcome to my online portfolio! :blush: 

This includes a taste of my talents with data analytics and coding, excluding my work with sensitive data. Navigate through the navigation tabs to see some of my work with Tableau, DataFrame, and Shorthand (a Python data project is comming soon). I hope you enjoy!

# About me

![WhatsApp Image 2023-10-10 at 11 07 50_850e0992](https://github.com/chrisbori/My-Online-Portfolio/assets/157328962/1df218ab-08d0-47a3-9d8e-660c06ea722b)

I'm a user-centric, digital transformation leader (and avid coffee-drinker) graduating from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2025. I'm proudly (some would say too proudly) from Carolina, Puerto Rico. 

I bring **experience with enterprise-level product implementation and road mapping, change management, and project management coupled with rigorous academics in data analytics and modeling**. In any team I’m a part of, my goal is to understand what people need in order to create the safest space possible for everyone. I think this brings out the best quality outputs from me, and I believe it’s the same for those in my team. I could bring this work ethic and adaptability to your team and organization to drive desired results. I could **connect to empower**.

# What I hope to learn

1. Color theory to support storytelling through data
2. Different types of vizualizations I have never worked with before (going beyond the bar chart, pie chart, and line chart trifecta)
3. Some Tableau
4. I have never worked with Github before, but it looks really cool! So that too :)
