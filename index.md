# About me

![WhatsApp Image 2023-10-10 at 11 07 50_850e0992](https://github.com/chrisbori/My-Online-Portfolio/assets/157328962/1df218ab-08d0-47a3-9d8e-660c06ea722b)

I'm a user-centric, digital transformation leader (and avid coffee-drinker) graduating from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2025. I'm proudly (some would say too proudly) from Carolina, Puerto Rico. 

I bring **experience with enterprise-level product implementation and road mapping, change management, and project management coupled with rigorous academics in data analytics and modeling**. In any team Iâ€™m a part of, my goal is to understand what people need in order to create the safest space possible for everyone. I think this brings out the best quality outputs from me, and I believe itâ€™s the same for those in my team. I could bring this work ethic and adaptability to your team and organization to drive desired results. I could **connect to empower**.
