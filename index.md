# About me

![1746042465390](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eb830ce-aa26-4037-b512-bb9b30d049ec)

I'm a user-centric, digital transformation leader (and avid coffee-drinker) who graduated from a Master of Science from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2025. Previously, I served as the first hire in the Digital Services team in the City of Syracuseâ€™s Digital Services department, where I led the product implementation of the City's new timekeeping system and helped build a digital transformation roadmap from the ground up.

I bring **experience with enterprise-level product implementation and road mapping, change management, and project management coupled with rigorous academics in data analytics and modeling**. In any team Iâ€™m a part of, my goal is to understand what people need in order to create the safest space possible for everyone. I think this brings out the best quality outputs from me, and I believe itâ€™s the same for those in my team. I could bring this work ethic and adaptability to your team and organization to drive desired results. I could **connect to empower**.
