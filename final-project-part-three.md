# The final data story
<script src="https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/whats-left-here-puerto-ricos-act-22/embed.js"></script>

# Changes made since Part II
* I did a lot. I planned on including correlational visuals, but while building the website, I decided to discard them. I felt like the story was already being told without. I did call out a correlation coefficient in the text though!
* Because of data format and entry complications, I did not include numbers on how much Act 22 beneficieries donated to political parties in Puerto Rico. I tried for a while, but it became to tedious and time consuming. .
* I switched between using dataframe and Tableau for my visualizations. Dataframe was awesome, but I needed more ability to customize sometimes. In those cases, I used Tableau.
* The cash chart is my favorite. I made that chart in excel, formatted it there, saved it as a picture, inserted it into PowerPoint, removed the graph itself in the picture and placed a picture of money under it.
* I came up with the visual of the medals after writing that sections, since I used the analogy in text. I also used PowerPoint to put the two pictures together (the medals are each from different stock photos).
* I created the timeline visual of Act 22 on PowerPoint. I think it's cute.
  
## The audience
I kept my primary audicence as Puerto Rican islanders and US Americans as a secondary audience. I decided to add a little blurb on how Act 22 can impact the US. 

## Final design decisions
* I basically completely ignored my storyboard and went for dark blue and orange highligts. I don't know how that happened but it did.
* I hate that I couldn't color match appropriately (for example, I wanted the cash chart to be the same blue backgroung as the introductory section, but failed).
* I loved scrollmotion and using complementary pictures. Also, since this is webpage, I used bold orange colors to emphasize fonts throughout. When I do this, I try to imagine someone reading through and only reading the bolded text. The idea is that they still get the jux of the story from the bolded text and visuals. 

# Final thoughts
The hardest part was collecting and cleaning the data. I used a mixture of Puerto Rican and US sources to put all the information together. Puerto Rico's data website is difficult to navigate to obtain the data needed. However, I reverted to A LOT googling, identifying resources through other articles, and so forth.

I really tried to incorporate the storytelling aspect of the project into my writing. Nearly every section starts with a snippet of a story, kind of. I hope it was awesome :)

Overall, I loved this project. It was very time consuming, but it was VERY time consuming. No, but seriously, it ewas really cool. Even in other course projects, I have noticed being unconsciously methodical about how I build visuals (whether a data viz or not). So thank you.
