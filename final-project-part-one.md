# Project Proposal: The Land of Beaches, Culture, Displacement and Inequity

## High-Level Summary
Similar to one of my previous assignments, I have decided to take a confirmatory approach with my final project. I also chose a... complicated story. So, let's go on this journey together. :blush:

**Note:**: Whenever I use the word "external", it refers to anything outside of Puerto Rico, including the United States. 

*  **Problem/Story**: Has Act 60 impacted displacement/gentrification in Puerto Rico in the past 7 years?
*  **Hypothesis/Assumption**: Act 60 has increased desplacement/gentirifcation in Puerto Rico, mostly due to its impact on housing values.
*  **Metrics to analyze**
   - Migration patterns
   - Housing values
   - Poverty rates
   - Gini index
   - Act 60 approvals
* **Context**: In the past 7 years (i.e., after hurricane María), displacement and gentrification have taken over island-Puerto Rican discourse as a hot, political topic. Many seem to blame the enactment of Act 20 and Act 22 of 2012, now merged into Act 60. Act 20 reduces the corporate rate tax to 4% (from the US's 21%) for local/external businesses with an external customer base. Act 22 reduces the capital gains tax to 0% for individual investors that have not lived in Puerto Rico, in other words, it can only apply to external investors willing to relocate to Puerto Rico for  minimum of 6 months (Acevedo, 2023). 

# Outline
* **My sister's story**: describing the difficulty of finding real estate in Puerto Rico. 
* **Snapshot: Puerto and the US**: providing a summary of the relationship between the US and Puerto Rico, mainly aspects that impact cost of living and migration.  
* **Poverty Rate of PR v. US states**: data viz #1 - show the jarring poverty rate of Puerto Rico. 

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
