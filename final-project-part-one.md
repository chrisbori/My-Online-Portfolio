# Project Proposal: The Land of Beaches, Culture, Displacement and Inequity

## High-Level Summary
Similar to one of my previous assignments, I have decided to take a confirmatory approach with my final project. I also chose a... complicated story. So, let's go on this journey together. :blush:

**Note:**: Whenever I use the word "external", it refers to anything outside of Puerto Rico, including the United States. 

*  **Problem/Story**: Has Act 60 impacted displacement/gentrification in Puerto Rico in the past 7 years? 
*  **Hypothesis/Assumption**: Act 60 has increased displacement/gentrification in Puerto Rico, mostly due to its impact on housing values.
*  **Metrics to analyze**
   - Migration patterns
   - Housing values
   - Poverty rates
   - Gini index
   - Act 60 approvals
   - _maybe_ Cash purchases of real estate
* **Context**: In the past 7 years (i.e., after hurricane María), displacement and gentrification have taken over island-Puerto Rican discourse as a hot, political topic. Many seem to blame the enactment of Act 20 and Act 22 of 2012, now merged into Act 60. Act 20 reduces the corporate rate tax to 4% (from the US's 21%) for local/external businesses with an external customer base. Act 22 reduces the capital gains tax to 0% for individual investors that have not lived in Puerto Rico, in other words, it can only apply to external investors willing to relocate to Puerto Rico for a minimum of 6 months (Acevedo, 2023). 

**Note:**: I am measuring displacement through outmigration, which will only reflect those who have left Puerto Rico. This is not perfect, but I found it difficult to obtain data on internal migration in direct linkage to displacement. With outmigration, this link is less blurry. Also, I am measuring gentrification through the increase in housing values and the increase in cash purchases of real estate. 

# Outline
### Summary 
I love summaries, so I  must. This section will be similar to the high-level summary above, but it will include a findings section and a conclusion section. 

### Introduction
* **My sister's story**: I want to start by grounding the project on a single story. I will use my sister's experience to describe the difficulty of finding real estate in Puerto Rico.
* **Why this matters**: I will assume Puerto Rican islanders are the main audience for this project. Here, I will describe how the answer to the question above can deepen our understanding of current issues in Puerto Rico and how that can translate to actions.
* **Snapshot: Puerto and the US**: I will assume US Americans are the secondary audience for this project. As such, I'll provide a summary of the relationship between the US and Puerto Rico, mainly aspects that impact cost of living and migration.  
  - **Poverty Rate of PR v. US states**: data viz #1 - show the jarring poverty rate of Puerto Rico. 

### Act 20 and 22
This section will provide a deeper (but still summarized) understanding of the Acts in question. I will mainly highlight certain changes from 2012 until now. For example, the governor eleminated the requirement to buy a property in Puerto Rico for Act 22 eligbility in 2017, which reignited the debate and arguably increased the rate of displacement (Suárez, Rodríguez Velázquez, and Sosa Pascual, 2022).
* **Approvals of Act 60 2012-2022**: data viz #2 - This will show the increase of approvals from 2017 till now.

### Puerto Rican migration and poverty
This section wil describe the migration patterns of Puerto Rico, i.e., the continuous exodus of Puerto Ricans to the United States
* **Population change rates in Puerto Rico**: data viz #3 - This will show the shift in population in Puerto Rico overtime, i.e., the continuous exodus. 
* **Correlation between Migration Pattern and Poverty Rate**: data viz #4 - This will also be confirmatory. I suspect there to be a negative relationship, indicative of displacement, i.e., most emigrants were below the poverty line, and as a result, exodus results in lower poverty rates. Not concreely sure this is the section for this viz, but we'll see.

### Housing Values in Puerto Rico: "Está cañón"
This section will dive into the increasing housing values in Puerto Rico. 
* **Housing values in Puerto Rico over the years**: data viz #5 - This will show how housing values have changed over time.
* **Housing purchases in cash**: data viz #6 - I'm having trouble getting this data, mainly due to the lack of documentation on cash purchases. In Puerto Rico, there law does not require tracking of real estate cash purchases (Suárez, Rodríguez Velázquez, and Sosa Pascual, 2022). However, the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo (Center of Investigative Journalism) was able to create a data viz with this information, which they warn heavily underestimates that actual amount of cash purchases ocurring in Puerto Rico (it still shows in insane increase in cash purchasing after 2017/20). If I cannot get a hold of this data, I may just use their viz and cite it.
* **Correlation of housing values and approvals of act 60**: data viz #7 - This will show a positive correlation between the two. This makes sense: if houses are sold cash-only, then who can actually just throw hudreds of thousands of dollars in cash? Yes, the richy rich. 
* **Correlation of housing values and migration**: data viz #7 - This is confirmatory. I'm guess a positive relationship between values and ourmigraiton. 

### Key Takeaways

## Initial sketches
**All correlations will use standard scatter plots**

**Poverty Rate of PR v. US states**: data viz #1

**Correlation of housing values and approvals of act 60**: data viz #7 
Like I mentioned before, all correlations will have a standard scatter plot, but I am considering the possibility of not using a correlational chart for this one. Instead, I may place two separate line charts right nect to each other with the same years (one for housing values and one for approvals).

# The data
Nearly all of my data is from the US Census Bureau (American Community Survey). This includes:
* Poverty rates from 2012 - 2022 of US states to compare the Puerto Rico poverty rate with US states in dataviz #1.
* Population counts of Puerto Rico from 2012 - 2022 to identify outmigration patterns and correlate the data with poverty in dataviz #4.
* Housing values in Puerto Rico from 2012 - 2022 to visualize change over the years in dataviz #5 and compare/correlate with other data (migration and approvals of act 60).

There are three exceptions that are not from the US Census:
* Data on Puerto Rico housing sales from the PR Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions: this is backup data and may replace housing values data from the US Census in my data vizualizations above.
* Data on Act 60 requests and approvals from 2012-2022 from the Instituto de Estadísticas de PR (Institute of Stats of PR) to showcase in dataviz #5 and compare to housing values in dataviz #7.
* (If I get it) Data on cash purchases of housing from the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo (Center of Investigative Journalism) / Tasamax to reflect increasing inaccessibility to property for dataviz #6. 

Here is a list of my data sources:
* [Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST5Y2022.S1701?q=poverty&g=040XX00US72&tp=false&tid=ACSST5Y2017.S1701): provides the poverty rate of Puerto Rico at a given year (I toggled the year and downloaded the dataset for each year)
* [Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2019]([url](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2010-2019/state/totals/nst-est2019-01.xlsx)): provides the population counts for Puerto Rico from 2010 - 2019
* [Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2020 to July 1, 2023]([url](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2020-2023/state/totals/NST-EST2023-POP.xlsx)): provides the population counts for Puerto Rico from 2020-23
* [Housing Values]([url](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2022.B25075?q=housing%20values&g=040XX00US72)): provides housing values categorized through ranges in Puerto Rico (I toggled the year and downloaded the dataset for each year)
* [Publicar Compra y Venta de Viviendas Nuevas y Usadas Sept. 2010 @ Dic. 2021]([url](https://estadisticas.pr/files/Inventario/publicaciones/Publicar%20Compra%20y%20Venta%20de%20Viviendas%20Nuevas%20y%20Usadas%20Sept.%202010%20%40%20Dic.%202021.xlsx)): provides housing sales and purchases data in Puerto Rico from 2010 - 2021
* [Tablas IEPR de Decretos Radicados y Aprobados DDEC - Abril 2022]([url](https://estadisticas.pr/files/Inventario/publicaciones/Tablas%20IEPR%20de%20Decretos%20Radicados%20y%20Aprobados%20DDEC%20-%20Abril%202022.xlsx)): provides the number of requests and pprovals of PR Act 60 from 2012-2022.

# Method and medium
I will use a mixture of Tableau and Excel to complete this project. All correlational analyses will be conducted in Excel, however, correlational data vizualizations will still be created in Tableau. All other data visualizations will be created in Tableau as well. I will very probably use Shorthand to put my story together in an immersive manner.
