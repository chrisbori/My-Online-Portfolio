# Project Proposal: The Land of Beaches, Culture, Displacement and Inequity

## High-Level Summary
Similar to one of my previous assignments, I have decided to take a confirmatory approach with my final project. I also chose a... complicated story. So, let's go on this journey together. :blush:

* **Context**: In the past 7 years (i.e., after hurricane MarÃ­a), displacement and gentrification have taken over island-Puerto Rican discourse as a hot, political topic. Many seem to blame the enactment of Act 20 and Act 22 of 2012 (now merged into Act 60), which provides hefty tax incentives to external businesses and investors (mainly US Americans). Specifically with Act 22, incentives cannot apply to locals. 
*  **Problem/Story**: Has Act 60 impacted displacement/gentrification in Puerto Rico in the past 7 years?
*  **Hypothesis/Assumption**: Act 60 has increased desplacement/gentirifcation in Puerto Rico, mostly due to its impact on housing values.
*  **Metrics to analyze**
   - Migration patterns
   - Housing values
   - Poverty rates
   - Gini index
   - Act 60 approvals

**Note:**: I'm considering comparing some of these metrics between the municipality of Dorado and Puerto Rico at large. 

# Outline
* **My sister's story**: describing the difficulty of finding real estate in Puerto Rico. 
* **Snapshot: Puerto and the US**: providing a summary of the relationship between the US and Puerto Rico, mainly aspects that impact cost of living and migration.  
* **Poverty Rate of PR v. US states**: data viz #1 - show the jarring poverty rate of Puerto Rico. 

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
